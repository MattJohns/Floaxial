# Floaxial
A modification for Minecraft that adds block physics.

# Overview

  - Make any block a falling type (stone, dirt, water).
  
  - Blocks move smoothly like regular sand but can also fall down slopes and form piles.
  
  - Built to tolerate slow multiplayer connections.
  
  - Processing can be limited by number of chunk per tick etc..
  
  - Uses plain rendering isntead of entities or block states.
